### Emphasis and Bolding

#### Italics

This *works*, and this _works_ too.  
asterics is preferred by the type of mark down used on GitHub

#### Bolding

This **works**, and this __works__ too.  
prefer the asterics to avoid misundertunding with the python syntax

### Blockquotes

> Markdown is intended to be as easy-to-read and easy-to-write as is feasible.
>
> Readability, however, is emphasized above all else. A Markdown-formatted document should be publishable as-is, as plain text, without looking like it's been marked up with tags or formatting instructions. - John Gruber
